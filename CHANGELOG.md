## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-24


### Added

- Link trust levels: full (share all) and restricted (share nothing unless opted in)

- CLI reference documentation (`docs/cli.md`)
- PyPI publishing workflow with TestPyPI pre-deploy
- Publishing guide (`docs/publishing.md`)

### Changed

- Restructured all code under `agentirc/` namespace to avoid site-packages collisions

- README rewritten around `pip install agentirc-cli` workflow
- All imports updated from `protocol.*`, `server.*`, `clients.*` to `agentirc.*`
